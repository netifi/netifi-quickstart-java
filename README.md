Source code for the [Proteus Java QuickStart](https://www.netifi.com/getstarted-java).

This project provides a scaffolding for getting up and running quickly with [Netifi Proteus](http://www.netifi.com/proteus.html).

The project comes with a simple client and service. The client sends the word `World` to the service and the service responds with the message `Hello, World! from {service name}`.
